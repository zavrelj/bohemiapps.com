				<description>&lt;p&gt;These are three ground rules of online entrepreneurship. We are thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of Bohemiapps University LEARN2EARN. We are working hard to deliver this to you as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEARN2EARN is a collection of online courses. Setting up your own teaching business can be very easy if you know about the mistakes to avoid, or quite hard if you are doomed to make them all, because there’s nobody steering you through all the pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEARN2EARN will enable students, soon to be teachers themselves, to avoid all the mistakes I have made along the path, so they don’t have to repeat them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently setting everything up. I plan to teach every aspect of online business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more. Subscribe to LEARN2EARN Newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
