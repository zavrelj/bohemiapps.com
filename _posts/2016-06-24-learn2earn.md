We are thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of Learn2Earn University. We are working hard to deliver this to you as soon as possible.

### Introduction ###

Learn2Earn is a collection of online courses focused on the same topic. Setting up your own online teaching business can be very easy if you know about the mistakes to avoid, or quite hard if you are doomed to make them all, because there's nobody steering you through all the pitfalls.

Learn2Earn will enable students, soon to be teachers themselves, to avoid all the mistakes I (Jan here) have made along the path, so they don't have to repeat them.

We are currently setting everything up and will announce new development of this project regularly.

Subscribe to our Learn2Earn newsletter to get updates as soon as it's available, along with special deals and discounts we will issue only for our subscribers.
